# burger

This program was created in the Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp 2019. It an application that guides the user to complete or edit a checklist of burgers that the have had or want to have in the future. This program challenges the coder to utilize the express, express handlebars, MySQL/JAWSDB, orm, and Node applications to create a website that draws from a database and intertwine it with a client's requests. The coder was also challenged to further practice full stack developing. 


## Burger road map for the page

Within the page, the client is given a previous list of burgers that want to eat in the future, and burgers they have already eaten.  The website allows the user to add new burgers to the "List of burgers to eat" list near the bottom of the page.  

Users can also edit the two lists of burgers by moving the "to eat" burgers with the "Devour" button to the "already eaten" list, they move the burgers from the "already eaten" list to the "to eat" list with the "get more" button, and they can completely delete the burger with the trash can button
